# Repomix Apprenticeship

> First-person, experiential learning path for using Repomix in real-world codebase analysis

## Philosophy

This is not a tutorial on "what Repomix is" - it's a hands-on apprenticeship showing **how we use Repomix** for specific tasks in our development workflow. This is learning by doing, with real examples from our actual work.

## Structure

- **00-getting-started.md** - Initial setup and first pack
- **01-pack-local-repo.md** - Packing your own repository
- **02-pack-remote-repo.md** - Packing GitHub repositories
- **03-grep-packed-output.md** - Searching packed repositories
- **04-migration-analysis.md** - Using Repomix to identify "budding shoots"
- **lessons-learned.md** - First-person experiential notes
- **exercises/** - Hands-on exercises

## Our Use Case

We use Repomix to:
1. Analyze repository structure for migration planning
2. Identify code vs data separation opportunities
3. Find "budding shoots" that should become separate repos
4. Support the Code Sculpting workflow

## Prerequisites

- Repomix installed (`npm install -g repomix` or via Homebrew)
- Basic familiarity with command line
- Understanding of git repositories

## Learning Approach

This follows a **praxis** approach - learning through reflection on action. Each lesson includes:
- What we did
- Why we did it
- What we learned
- How to apply it
